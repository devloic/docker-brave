Brave is a free and open-source web browser developed by Brave under Â [MPL-2.0 license](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser#MPL-2.0-1-ov-file)

## Quick Start

Launch the brave docker container with the following command:
```shell
docker run --privileged -p 5800:5800 -p 5900:5900 -v ./sharedwithhost:/config/sharedwithhost -e WEB_AUDIO=1 docker.io/devloic/docker-brave

Where:

  - `./sharedwithhost`: This is where you can save files with brave and share it with the host.

Browse to `http://your-host-ip:5800` to access the Brave GUI.
VNL your-host-ip:5900

The image is based on alpine. For now Brave is available as a flatpak on alpine. Flatpak needs privileged access to run inside a container.
If this a problem for you, use podman. In privileged mode with podman, the container cannot have more privileges than the account that launched it.

```
```shell
podman run --privileged -p 5800:5800 -p 5900:5900 -v ./sharedwithhost:/config/sharedwithhost -e WEB_AUDIO=1 docker.io/devloic/docker-brave
```
